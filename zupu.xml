<!-- Okay, here is an example XML template for a comprehensive family tree. This structure aims for flexibility and the ability to capture rich detail, using IDs and references to link entities together.

Key Concepts Used:

Separate Sections: Individuals (<People>), Families (<Families>), Events (<Events>), Places (<Places>), Sources (<Sources>), and Notes (<Notes>) are grouped for clarity.

IDs and References: Each major entity (Person, Family, Event, Source, Place, Note) has a unique id attribute. Relationships are established using reference attributes (e.g., personRef, familyRef, sourceRef, placeRef) that point to these ids. This avoids deep nesting and easily handles complex scenarios like remarriage, adoption, multiple sources per fact, etc.

Attributes for Metadata: Attributes are used for IDs, references, types (gender, event type), and certainty qualifiers.

Elements for Content: Elements hold primary data like names, dates, descriptions, citations, etc.

<!--
Explanation:

<FamilyTree>: The root element, potentially containing metadata about the file itself. The xmlns attribute declares a namespace, which is good practice for preventing naming conflicts if this data were combined with other XML vocabularies.

<People>: Contains all individuals. Each <Person> has a unique id and optional gender.

<Name>: Nested within <Person>. Can have a type (birth, married, aka) and contains parts like <Given> and <Surname>. Multiple <Name> elements allow for name changes/variations.

<Families>: Defines family units. Each <Family> has an id.

<Partner>/<Child>: Inside <Family>, these elements use the ref attribute to link to the id of the corresponding <Person> entries. This clearly defines the structure of each family unit.

<Events>: Contains specific life events. Each <Event> has an id and a type (birth, death, marriage, residence, baptism, etc.).

personRef links an event to an individual (like birth/death).

familyRef links an event to a family unit (like marriage/divorce).

<Date>: Inside <Event>, specifies the date. The value could be in a standard format (like ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD), and qualifier adds context (exact, about, before, after, between).

<PlaceRef>: Inside <Event>, links to a detailed place definition in the <Places> section using its ref attribute.

<SourceRef>: Inside <Event> (or potentially attached to <Person>, <Name>, <Family>), links to one or more sources in the <Sources> section.

<Places>: Contains detailed definitions of locations. Each <Place> has an id. Can include Name, Type, geographic Coordinates, and potentially a PartOf reference for hierarchy (e.g., a hospital being part of a city).

<Sources>: Contains detailed information about the sources of information (certificates, census records, books, interviews). Each <Source> has an id. Includes Title, Citation text, Repository, etc.

<Notes>: Contains free-text notes. Each <Note> has an id and can be linked from Persons, Families, Events, or Sources using <NoteRef>.

This structure provides a robust framework. You would typically use an XML Schema (XSD) alongside this to enforce the structure, data types (like dates), and ensure that all references (ref) point to valid existing ids.
